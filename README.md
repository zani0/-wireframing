## 📌 What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a critical step in the design process where a basic, visual guide is created to represent the skeletal structure of a digital interface—such as a website or mobile app. It focuses on layout, content placement, and functionality, rather than on colors, images, or typography.

## 🧠 Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders:

- **Visualize the structure** of the user interface before development begins.
- **Clarify navigation flow** and user interactions.
- **Identify usability issues** early in the design phase.
- **Save time and resources** by catching problems before they reach development.
- **Facilitate collaboration** across teams by aligning on structure and priorities.

Wireframes serve as the blueprint of a project, ensuring that everyone is on the same page before diving into high-fidelity design or coding.

## 📁 Repository Purpose

This repository contains sample wireframes, templates, and documentation related to the wireframing process. It is intended to help designers and developers understand and apply wireframing best practices in their projects.
